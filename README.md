# intranet_google
This is the intranet made for google employers, we can create our email messages and in the future we'll be able to consult our procedures as well.

Before start, create a new file called "conexao.php" and put our conexion info there as bellow in line 5 and 6:
<?php
$conexao = mysqli_connect('server', 'user', 'password', 'database');
And please, change the values of server, user password and database.
